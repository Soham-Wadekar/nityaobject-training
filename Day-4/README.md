# Day 4 Log

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
> Learn about multithreading and implement it in Python.

**METHODOLOGY**  
1. Studied Pythonâ€™s `threading` module and official documentation.  
2. Practiced thread creation, synchronization, and thread pooling.  
3. Explored advanced concepts like subclassing and daemon threads.

**WHAT I LEARNED**  
1. Threads allow concurrent execution and are created using `Thread(target=...)`.  
2. `Lock` is used to prevent race conditions in shared data access.  
3. `ThreadPoolExecutor` manages multiple threads efficiently and simplifies execution.  
4. Daemon threads run in the background and terminate when the main program exits.
